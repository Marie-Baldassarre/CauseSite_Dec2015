	 </h2> 
	<h2> As Hillary campaigns across the country, she'll be talking about more issues-- stay tuned. </h2> 

	<h4> Campaign Finance Reform </h4>

	<p>	Hillary is calling for aggressive campaign finance reform to end the stranglehold that wealthy interests have over our political system and restore a government of, by, and for the people—not just the wealthy and well-connected. Her proposals will curb the outsized influence of big money in American politics, shine a light on secret spending, and institute real reforms to raise the voices of regular voters. </p>
		
	 <h4> Criminal Justice Reform </h4> 
	<p>Hillary believes our criminal justice system is out of balance. In her first major speech of the campaign, she said we have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America and called for an end to the “era of mass incarceration.” </p>
	
	<p>Hillary believes that, to successfully reform our criminal justice system, we must work to strengthen the bonds of trust between our communities and our police, end the era of mass incarceration, and ensure a successful transition of individuals from prison to home. As president, she will: </p>
		
			<ul>
				<li> Work to strengthen bonds of trust between communities and police </li>
				<li> Making new investments to support state-of-the-art law enforcement training programs at every level </li>
				<li>Doubling funding for the U.S Department of Justice "Collaborative Reform" program </li>
				<li> And much more! </li>
			</ul>
